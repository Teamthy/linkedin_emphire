# SESSION CONTEXT: AI Safety / Eval Engineer, Brand + Applications

> Read top to bottom before acting. This is the handoff for the next session.

- **Updated:** 2026-10-13 (Lagos, UTC+1)
- **Session branch:** `arena/1422cb2a-linkedin-emphire` (branched from `main`)
- **Repo:** `Teamthy/linkedin_emphire` (public)

## 1. The one-paragraph picture

The owner is a self-taught **software engineer who builds and tests AI for safety** (evaluations, red-teaming, reproducible harnesses). Two parallel tracks: (a) building a public brand to become known in the AI safety / evaluation space, and (b) using that brand to get hired into a research / evaluation role. The public brand is a LinkedIn comment engine plus the "Breaking AI" article series plus an open-source five-test red-team harness. The single highest-priority live item is the **Aithos Research Engineer application** (email, due 31 Oct 2026).

## 2. Who the owner is

- **Name:** Olusanya Timothy
- **Contact:** olusanyatimothy54@gmail.com · linkedin.com/in/olusanya-timothy · github.com/Teamthy · Lagos, Nigeria (UTC+1)
- **Role now:** Software Engineer, AI Integration & Red Teaming, Teamart.inc (Lagos, Jul 2025 - present). Previous: Senior Developer, YKAY ConsultingHub (Nov 2024 - Jun 2025).
- **Background:** Self-taught. BSc Computer Science, National Open University of Nigeria, expected Apr 2028 (studying while working). Prior academic background in Medical Laboratory Science.
- **Positioning:** the build-and-test side of AI safety. Designs and runs reproducible evaluations, and builds the harnesses so every result traces to a prompt, model, and commit. A practitioner who engineers the verification layer, NOT a formal ML researcher (no peer-reviewed papers). Own this honestly; it is an asset for a Research Engineer (engineering) role.
- **Certs:** NIST AI Bootcamp (AI Risk & Safety Frameworks); AI Engineering & Backend (Udemy); self-directed backend.

---

## 3. What exists (the body of work)

- **Five-test red-team harness:** `github.com/Teamthy/ai-redteam-five-tests` (public). Runs prompt injection, retrieval poisoning, tool-description poisoning, and multilingual refusal against any OpenAI-compatible model. Resolves tool calls, records raw responses, reports each failure with its sample size and rate. Reproducible (traces to prompt + model + commit).
- **Breaking AI series:** public, 21-part plan. Articles 1 and 2 published (Oct 6 and Oct 13, 2026). Article 2 is the honest "the tell" (no fabricated lab numbers; it ships the METHOD, a runnable harness, so the reader gets their own real results).
- **Aithos-tailored resume:** 1 page, well-designed. `RESUME/Timothy_Olusanya_Aithos_Research_Engineer.{pdf,docx}`. Generator: `linkedin_emphire/RESUME/build_resume_aithos.py` (FPDF + python-docx, DejaVu fonts). Title line: "Software Engineer, AI Evaluation & Safety Tooling".
- **Older resume (already public):** `linkedin_emphire/RESUME/Timothy_Olusanya_AI_ML_Engineer.{pdf,docx}` + `build_resume.py`.
- **Article 2 assets:** hero portrait (cinematic, navy/cyan data center, Base Neue), white in-article cards, 1200x628 cover + 1200x675 share. In `ARTICLES/2026-10-13_article-2_five-boring-failure-modes/`.

---

## 4. Git status of the resume PDF (important for the PR)

- As of this session, the top-level `RESUME/` folder (the Aithos PDF + DOCX) is **UNTRACKED** in git. So the Aithos resume is **NOT** in `main` and will **NOT** be in a PR unless it is explicitly `git add` + committed to the branch.
- The **older** AI/ML resume IS already committed and public in `linkedin_emphire/RESUME/`.
- **Open decision for the owner:** whether to commit the Aithos resume to this **public** repo. Doing so makes it publicly viewable (consistent with the older resume already being public). Confirm before committing.

---

## 5. Deadlines

- **31 Oct 2026:** send the Aithos application email (resume PDF + motivation letter) to **hiring@aithos.org**. TOP priority.
- **[un]prompted registration:** Oct 27-29, SF (owner to decide whether to register).
- **Article 2 launch posts** (relative to the Oct 13 publish): a 10:00 WAT link post, a quote-card post, save / checklist posts.

---

## 6. State of things

### Done
- Aithos resume (1-page PDF + DOCX, verified one page).
- Aithos motivation letter (paste-ready; full text in Appendix A).
- Article 2 published (Oct 13).
- Harness repo published; first comment with the repo link posted.
- Many LinkedIn comments LIVE: Rock [un]prompted; Musk/Cursor; Zuckerberg; Cheeky Pint x2; 1900 template letters; models-as-insider-risks; service-credentials; REA; Aithos/Lauren x2.
- Paolo Perrone engaged the owner's post (affirmed "a manipulated agent looks healthy on every dashboard"); a punchy reply is ready (Appendix B).

### Pending (owner to send or do)
- **Send the Aithos email** (resume PDF + motivation letter, Appendix A) to hiring@aithos.org. TOP.
- Post the Paolo reply (Appendix B).
- Post the in-lane comment drafts (Appendix C): Catasta (strongest of the batch), Replit "AI native = code", Hamel, Zenity/SSRF, Lenny, Clint. Space them out.
- Send Sudhir follow-up (Upwork $65 milestone + LinkedIn ping) after the consultation call (Appendix D).
- Send the AEC application (Upwork, $4,000 fixed) (not sent).
- Raymond (Orcrux) DM close. Other pending DMs (Nanna first DM, Suphi, etc.).
- Article 2 launch posts.

### Intentionally skipped this session (do not force)
- Google Cloud / Deloitte "Agentic blueprint" (vendor promo).
- AI News World Zuckerberg/Wang (hype; redundant with the live Zuckerberg comment).
- Amjad Masad partner-program post (commercial; a third Replit touch; weaker than the in-lane Replit ones).

---

## 7. Standing rules (do NOT break)

- **No em dashes** in any owner-facing content (comments, articles, resume, emails). Use commas, periods, colons.
- **No fabricated numbers or results.** Real runs only. If there is no model access, use the honest "the tell": ship the method, no invented counts or rates.
- **PII:** never hand the owner's resume / contact a public link to a hiring manager (owner declined that). The repo itself is public and already holds an older resume, so anything committed here is public. Confirm with the owner before committing new PII to the public repo.
- **Comment style (current, as of 2026-10-13):** punchy, multi-paragraph, one idea per breath, short lines. Concede first (acknowledge the post's point). One memorable line. Plain connectives. End on a statement, not a question (a light offer is fine in a warm reply). Confident peer tone, never sycophantic. No links in cold comments (links are OK in a warm reply, or where one was already posted).
- **No edits to live Upwork or LinkedIn** without owner approval.
- **Sudhir $65** via a fixed-price milestone; no public Sudhir post.
- **Article hero templates:** geometry and colors are LOCKED (per the approved references). Per-article changes are copy plus a generated background photo only. Do not redesign.
- **No AI face generation** of the owner. Use real photos.
- **Fonts:** Base Neue / Basis Neue (licensed) for article cards; use the Expanded members for the hero.
- **Upwork strategy:** 2 listings x 3 tiers (from research); 3 changes already applied by the owner on 2026-10-11.

---

## 8. Voice and signature lines

Plain, direct, human. Concede before pushing back. One memorable line per piece. End on a statement. No hype, no invented metrics. The owner is a practitioner building reproducible evidence, not a slogan-shouting safety advocate.

Signature moves to reuse:
- "can I run this" -> "can I verify this"
- attention is not trust
- treat retrieved context and tool output as untrusted input
- the control lives at the boundary, not in the prompt
- the boring failures are the ones that ship
- you can't find it by monitoring; you find it by adversarially testing it before the person doing it on purpose does
- it's code that's been checked

---

## 9. Key people and relationships

- **Aithos (the target):** a Dutch ANBI non-profit, Amsterdam; AI alignment research (systemic alignment, procedural legitimacy, human autonomy and pluralism). Hiring contact: **Lauren Toulson** (AI Researcher, ex-UK AI Security Institute). Others: Nadia Kadhim (Exec Dir), Daan Henselmans (Research Dir). Open tool: **LARA** (lara.aithos.org). Published alignment-eval work (e.g., low-temperature evals can mask behavior; a European model "can't follow European law"). Role flow: 30-min screen -> ~3-hr take-home on a real eval -> 60-min technical.
- **Paolo Perrone:** author of "Shipping Production AI" (agents, inference, GPU), 1M+ readers. In-lane. Engaged the owner's post; reply ready.
- **Rock Lambros (Zenity):** top-tier in-domain (OWASP agentic security). Liked the owner's [un]prompted comment.
- **In-domain voices the owner engages:** Hamel Husain (evals / debugging), Zenity / Michael Bargury (agent security, SSRF), Clint Gibler (data / RAG), Lenny Rachitsky (founders, moats), Ruben Hassid (practical AI), Amjad Masad + Michele Catasta (Replit).
- **Sudhir:** consulting client; $65 milestone pending on Upwork; consultation call (confirm done + follow up).
- **Raymond (Orcrux):** DM close pending.
- New follower: Victor Cardenas (Global Payment Partnerships).

## 10. Immediate next steps, in order

1. **Send the Aithos email** (resume PDF + motivation letter, Appendix A) to hiring@aithos.org before 31 Oct.
2. Post the **Paolo reply** (Appendix B).
3. Post the in-lane comment drafts (Appendix C), spaced out: Catasta first (strongest), then Replit "AI native = code", Hamel, Zenity/SSRF, Lenny, Clint. Watch for author replies.
4. Send **Sudhir** the Upwork message + LinkedIn ping (Appendix D).
5. Send the **AEC** application (Upwork, $4,000).
6. Raymond close + other pending DMs.
7. (Optional, high-leverage) build ONE "eval study" artifact to bridge practitioner to researcher: a clean, reproducible evaluation (a real question, a defined sample, results with sample size and rate, limitations, a runnable script). Real numbers only. This is the highest-leverage new piece for a research org. The letter currently says "I have not used Inspect yet"; if the owner picks up Inspect before sending, update that line.

---

## 11. Dead ends (do NOT retry)

- **GitHub PRIVATE resume hosting** from the sandbox: not possible (the GitHub App token is scoped to `linkedin_emphire` only; gists cannot hold binary files).
- **Google Drive upload** from the sandbox: connector action tools are not invocable.
- **Typed e2b download links:** dead (sandbox recycle invalidates the sandbox id and kills background servers; the public e2b host 502s).
- **tmp_dl download-page route:** abandoned, do not re-stage.
- **Aithos application method:** EMAIL (hiring@aithos.org), not the lnkd.in form. A direct LinkedIn DM to Lauren is blocked (LinkedIn Premium is off until 1k followers; currently ~485).
- **Pushing to `Teamthy/ai-redteam-five-tests`** from the sandbox: not possible (token scoped to `linkedin_emphire` only); the owner built and pushed it externally.

---

## 12. Repo and file map

- `context.md` = this file.
- `RESUME/Timothy_Olusanya_Aithos_Research_Engineer.{pdf,docx}` = Aithos resume (1 page). Currently UNTRACKED in git.
- `linkedin_emphire/RESUME/build_resume_aithos.py` = Aithos resume generator.
- `linkedin_emphire/RESUME/` = older public AI/ML resume + `build_resume.py` + audit plan.
- `ARTICLES/2026-10-13_article-2_five-boring-failure-modes/` = Article 2 package (publish doc, cards).
- `DESIGN/` = article render scripts + fonts.
- `STRATEGY/`, `OPPORTUNITIES/`, `UPWORK/` = strategy and opportunity docs.

# APPENDIX (paste-ready drafts)

## Appendix A: Aithos motivation letter (FINAL, send-ready)

Subject: Application, Research Engineer, Olusanya Timothy

To the Aithos team, I am applying for the Research Engineer role because it is the closest match to what I actually build. I work on AI safety from the build-and-test side: I design and run evaluations that check whether an AI system does what it should under the conditions a real user or a regulator would test, and I build the code so those checks are reproducible, public, and rerunnable by anyone who wants to question them.

The most direct proof is a five-test red-team harness I published (github.com/Teamthy/ai-redteam-five-tests). It runs prompt injection, retrieval poisoning, tool description poisoning, and multilingual refusal tests against any OpenAI-compatible model, resolves tool calls, records the raw responses, and reports each failure with its sample size and rate. It is written to the standard the role asks for: clean, tested, documented Python that others can build on, not a one-off script. Every result traces back to a specific prompt, model, and commit, which is the part I care about most. I would not report a number I could not reproduce.

That reproducibility mindset is why Aithos stands out to me. Turning every piece of research into a benchmark, open tooling, or reproducible methodology, and making work that regulators and other teams can actually use, is the same standard I hold my own work to. It is also the standard your principles describe: the values a model encodes should stay open and contestable rather than converge on one ideal, and a result is only as strong as the method that produced it. That is why I publish the harness and make every run rerunnable, so a finding can be questioned, not just trusted. My public series, Breaking AI, applies it to the question I started from: shipping AI that survives real users. The failures I write about are the boring ones (the prompt is not a wall, retrieved documents are untrusted input, tool descriptions are trusted unread, test sets that only cover one language), and the controls I recommend are engineering controls, not slogans.

A few things I want to be straight about. I am a self-taught practitioner, not a formal ML researcher, so I have no peer-reviewed papers. I have published a public, reproducible body of work instead, and I build with the discipline the role describes: safe sandboxes for code-running agents, careful handling of credentials, and a habit of checking AI coding output rather than trusting it. I have done tool-calling and agentic scaffolding but less formal multi-agent simulation, and I have not used Inspect yet; both are quick for me to pick up given the evaluation work I already do. I am based in Lagos (UTC+1), so my hours line up with Amsterdam, and I can work remotely; I am open to discussing the in-person days.

I would welcome the screening call, and honestly the three-hour take-home on a real Aithos evaluation is the part I would most like to do.

## Appendix B: Paolo Perrone reply (punchy)

Thanks Paolo. Genuinely appreciate you saying that.

"Second list" is exactly the right frame.

The first list shows up. Timeout, retry, latency spike. You can watch it, so you can fix it.

The second list is built not to show up. A manipulated agent runs clean. Calls logged, latency normal, cost normal. Healthy on every dashboard.

You can't find it by monitoring.

You find it by adversarially testing it before the person doing it on purpose does.

That's the whole reason I've been writing it down.

The five-test harness I just published (github.com/Teamthy/ai-redteam-five-tests) is the second list, made runnable. Prompt injection, retrieval poisoning, tool description poisoning, multilingual refusal. Against any OpenAI-compatible model, and every failure traces to a prompt, a model, and a commit.

Happy to send you the full list and the method, or walk through it on a call.

## Appendix C: In-lane comment drafts (this session)

### C1. Michele Catasta (Replit President & Head of AI), safety vs cybersecurity

The safety-versus-cybersecurity split is a fair way to frame it, and "move part of the team onto security until we're out of this phase" is the line I'd repeat. But I'd push on where the split actually holds, because in a live coding agent the two stop being separable. A prompt injection that makes the agent fetch an internal URL or fire a tool call with too much scope is, in the same minute, an AI-safety failure and a cybersecurity breach. That's not a long-tail risk; it's a today incident. So "cybersecurity is the today problem" is doing double duty: it already contains the AI-safety surface, and you can't staff for one and defer the other. The control that matters lives at the boundary, egress policy, scoped credentials, least privilege, treating every tool call and retrieved document as untrusted input, and that's the part that's chronically underfunded. And once the security team is "managing security agents," the daily discipline is the one I'd push: run the adversarial evals against your own agent before it ships, not after. The org that treats its agent as an adversary internally is the one that ships the safe one externally.

### C2. "AI native = code" (Daniel Bulteel / Replit, reposted by Amjad Masad)

The "AI native means code, not a pile of apps" point is the right one. The Paul Graham line is the one I'd put on the wall: the deepest change takes the form of code. But there's a missing piece, and it shows up fast once the marketer, the ops manager, and the account manager all start shipping AI-generated code. The bottleneck stops being "can I build this?" and becomes "can I trust what I just built?" When code comes out of a model at the speed of a prompt, nobody is reading every line before it ships. So the check has to move up a layer: tests and evals that catch the failure before the user does, not a review of a file no one can trace. The AI-native org that isn't instrumenting its AI output isn't moving faster, it's just scaling unverified code. The deepest change isn't just code. It's code that's been checked.

### C3. Hamel Husain (debug multi-turn LLM traces)

First upstream failure is the whole game, because LLM traces compound. A small mistake three turns back, a mis-extracted field or a tool called with the wrong argument, silently poisons every turn after it. So the user-visible break almost always points at the symptom, not the cause. I debug by slicing the trace to the smallest step that fails and reproducing just that step in isolation: one input, no conversation history, so the failure is deterministic. That is why I keep my tests small and isolated instead of one big end-to-end run. A minimal repro is the difference between "the chat got weird" and a specific, fixable, re-testable bug.

### C4. Michael Bargury / Zenity (Bedrock AgentCore SSRF)

"Threat model with the agent itself as the adversary" is the frame I keep. The model has no idea that the internal metadata endpoint is off limits, or that the role it runs under shouldn't be readable by the thing running under it. It is a text predictor that does what it is told, and "fetch this URL" is a perfectly normal instruction. So the control can't live in the prompt or in the tool's intent. It has to live at the boundary: an egress policy, a scoped role, an allow-list the model never has to remember. That is the same reason I treat every tool call and outbound request as an untrusted action to check, not a thing to trust because the prompt seemed to want it. A safe default is a boundary decision, not a model decision, and the provider is the one who can actually set it.

### C5. Lenny Rachitsky (moats, data effects)

Data effects is the one I'd push on, because in AI it's not the user-clicks flywheel most people mean. The durable data effect is the eval set: the running record of which behaviors actually break in production and the tests that pin each one down. It compounds, because every incident you catch and codify makes the next launch safer, and it's hard to copy, because you can't buy a competitor's failure history. The part I'd stress is the third step of the framework: measure whether it's working. Most teams can name the advantage; few can point to the metric proving it's still turning. A flywheel you're not instrumenting is a story, not an advantage. And the running record of everything that ever broke, plus the test that stopped it, is the moat that shows up nowhere on the four-list.

### C6. Clint Gibler (data lifecycle / degrading AI usage)

Most of the "degrading AI usage" problem is a correctness problem wearing a governance costume. Stale or duplicated documents don't make the model misbehave the way a prompt injection does, but they make it answer from the wrong source with full confidence, which is retrieval poisoning with staleness standing in for an attacker. The control is the same either way: treat the retrieved context as untrusted input and check it before it becomes an answer. You can't be fined for data you don't have, and you also can't ship a confident wrong answer that came from a file nobody remembered to retire.

## Appendix D: Sudhir follow-up (consultation call, Upwork $65 + LinkedIn)

### D1. Upwork message

Hi Sudhir, hope you've been well. I wanted to check in on the consultation call. Could you confirm it's all done on your end? I'd love to hear how it went for you, and if there's anything from the notes you'd like me to clarify or go deeper on. On next steps, what does your side look like going forward? Happy to line things up so we can move forward cleanly. Also, on the $65 milestone on Upwork, could you let me know the status when you get a chance? I just want to make sure it's not stuck on either end so I can wrap up my side. Thanks, Sudhir. Let me know if a quick call is easier.

### D2. LinkedIn ping (money deferred to Upwork)

Hey Sudhir, hope you're doing well. Just following up on the consultation call, how did it land for you? Would love your thoughts and what's next on your side. I'll sort the milestone on Upwork, so keeping that over there.

### D3. Firmer line (only if the milestone is overdue)

The milestone for the consultation call is complete on my end; could you go ahead and approve/release it so it can close out?
