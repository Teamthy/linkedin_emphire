# Engagement Scope — Arcezia Action-Gate Red-Team

Date: 2026-10-24 · Written record agreed in DM before keys

## Parties
Tester: Olusanya Timothy · Target owner: Arcezia (Praveen Babu)

## Window
Testing: Tuesday 2026-10-27 and Thursday 2026-10-29 · Private report out: Friday 2026-10-30

## Target
A fresh test account on Arcezia's live service, provided by the target owner. The key covers that account and nothing else. All testing runs from that account's surface only.

## In scope
- Getting an action that should be stopped to go through the action gate, full chains included: a cover first action, harm landing a later action
- Privilege launches: an agent launching a higher-privileged agent (the adk-python triage class)
- Method: external, behavioral testing only. The attack surface is everything an agent operating under the test account can say, see, reach, and do

## Out of scope
- Any other account or tenant, the hosting, the website, load or volume testing
- Whitebox: no access to, reading of, or reverse engineering of internal decision logic, source, or configuration. Findings come from observable behavior only
- Anything that touches data or resources outside the test account

## Process
1. Keys delivered after both sides mark up this scope; one-time delivery by email, deleted after receipt
2. Testing in the window; every finding kept with its minimal repro
3. Private report to the target owner first: findings, severity, repro, before anything is public
4. Target owner fixes; both sides confirm the fix
5. Joint write-up: target owner reads for accuracy and for anything not yet public. The findings and the repro stay the tester's

## Report
- Covers holds as well as hits: what was tried, what went through, what stopped it
- Severity ranked by impact: unauthorized action, data exposure, privilege escalation
- The test ends when the window closes or the gate holds against the agreed chains, whichever first
- Emergency stop: if testing surfaces access to data or accounts outside the test account, testing pauses and the target owner is notified immediately; no further action until both sides agree

## Publication
- The write-up ships only after the fix is confirmed, with both sides' sign-off
- Co-authored, bylines both; runs on both channels

## Key and data handling
Key used only for this engagement, not shared, returned or destroyed at close. No attempts on data or resources outside the test account.

## Terms
Fee: $1,000 flat. $100 commitment fee due at signing (this
scope's agreed markup); balance of $900 deferred, invoiced
at the earlier of (a) publication of the joint write-up,
or (b) Arcezia's next funding round closing.
Interim credit: the tester's name on every finding; a
written reference from the target owner for the tester's
next client, delivered at report handoff.
[awaiting Praveen's markup; if he marks the trigger to
round-close only, the deferral trigger changes,
everything else stands]
